            <h3><a href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay.com</a></h3>
            <p>Ebay is an online commerce site that allows for individual sellers to sell/auction off their goods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast- Ebay tends to use a base background color of white and overlaying a bright colored div on top of it which is poor contrast design as they could have picked colors that mix well instead of throwing a bright color on anoher bright color.</li>
                <li>Repition- Ebay fails to adhere to the R in CRAP principles of visual design through their use of oddly shaped divs that hold links to other pages such as on their home page linking to various types of goods.</li>
                <li>Alignment- The site seems to use a center align for catergories of items while individual products themselves are described using a left align.</li>
                <li>Proximity- Ebay, as you can see from their home page doesn't seem to have much regard for the padding on the sides of their page in comparison to elements within the center of the page. this can be seen when you look at the top bar that has icons for signing in or viewing your profile.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3><a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit.com</a></h3>
            <p>Reddit is a social media forum based site that allows for users to share their opinions and information in a thread based system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast- Reddit has a monotone visual design when it comes to contrast utilizing a dark blue  color and white text which allows for text to be clearly seen</li>
                <li>Repition- Reddit is able to show good repition through the even uniformly shaped and placed divs on the left and right hand sides of the main site.</li>
                <li>Alignment- The alignment of the Reddit site is optimal due to the fact that all of the text elements on the main site are cleanly left aligned in their respective divs.</li>
                <li>Proximity- The proximity of text elements and image divs are appealing to the eyes as there is not a inconsistent spacing between the text contained in the elements and the space around the element itself.</li>
            </ul>
