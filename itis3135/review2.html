        <ul>
            <li>Page leads to correct page to be reviewd.</li>
            <li>Page has no spaces or uppercases in file/folder names.</li>
            <li>Design:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Page has good contrast.</li>
                <li>Page has good site colors and font colors along with CSS contained in seperate file.</li>
                <li>CRAP:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Site has good contrast between text and background colors.</li>
                    <li>Site has good repitition across site pages in terms of color usage and site components.</li>
                    <li>Site has good alignment for the most part. I personally think that the P elements on the home page should have more margin as it makes the site look very busy near the top but not as much as you go down.</li>
                    <li>Proximity is good but I would put the navbar in some sort of box but if that conflicts with design choices, it is not necessary.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Page includes a header, main, and footer</li>
                <li>Site has brand name within an H1</li>
                <li>Main starts with page title as H2</li>
                <li>There is a tagline with a slogan</li>
                <li>Page does not have footer with validation although the disability validation does not seem to show the image for the validator</li>
