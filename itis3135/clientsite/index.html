        <p>Hello new friends! </p>
        <p>I’m Alex, sometimes known as Sommie, and I’ve been creating for as long as I can remember. </p>
        <p>It’s my fervent belief that creation is one of the pillar-stones of being and I am beyond excited to be able
            to share my projects (upcoming, current, or past) with you! </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy the art and maybe even commission some of your own, but most of all I look forward to
            getting to know you if you join one of my communities like my discord server, Sommie’s Teatime! Perhaps you
            can share some of your own art on there or maybe art that inspires you!</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, I’m grateful you happened upon my little world and I really hope you enjoy your stay!
        </p>
        <p>Love, Alex</p>
