            <p>Noah is the main character in a fantasy slice of life game that I’m working on where he develops and maintains a tavern that trades jobs rather than money. With his design, I wanted it to be clear that he’s very capable of taking care of himself, but also isn’t all that ‘stylish’ or put-together, because he cares far more on getting stuff done. He was once a doctor, but now he lives in the forest after a traumatic experience and his remedies are far more herbalism-inclined. He’s an elf who can turn into a fox. I wanted the fox form to be more simplistic because I don’t want it to be the focus of his character.</p>

            <p>This is a project I’m working on to practice animating things at different rates. The girl will be floating among different objects that bounce at different intervals.</p>

            <p>Luca is one of the love interests in a modern slice of life game that I’m developing. He’s obsessed with plants and treats the people around him like plants that he must care for. He’s stern, dedicated, and quite intelligent. I wanted this to be reflected in his outfit through a certain level of practicality and simplicity.</p>

            <p>Mabel is another love interest in the same game as Luca. She’s a makeup influencer who is a talented special effects artist, though that is not emphasized in her channel. She’s quite bubbly, enthusiastic, and feminine. I wanted to reflect this through her appearance by incorporating a lot of roundness and fluffy shapes.</p>

            <p>Fable is the protagonist in a superhero/supervillain comic that I’m making. I struggled a lot with her appearance and she definitely went through a lot of phases, but I think I’ve settled on this practical, but fitted outfit for her villain costume. The cardigan flows in a way very similar to her smoke abilities and her mask references her villain name ‘plague’. While this version of her costume likely won’t appear in the comic until much later, it is definitely my favorite iteration so far.</p>
