            <p>The piano is an extrodinary instrument created by Bortolomeo Cristofori. The man from Italy was deeply unsatisfied with the lack of control that musicians had over the volume of the, then widely played harpsichord. The main functional difference between the harpsichord and the piano is that, while a harpsichord uses a plucking mechanism to produce sound from the strings, a piano uses a hammer that makes contact with the strings to produce the sound, thus making the piano a percussion instrument!</p>

            <p>My journey with playing the piano started almost 9 years ago when I had just started middle school and wanted to be in band. Our middle school didn't offer keyboard or piano in the band so I played the tuba. But while I played the tuba in school, I wanted nothing more than a piano to play at home. My parents, after much convincing bought me a 200 dollar piano that I would play for hours a day. It was only after 3 years of playing on that piano that I upgrading to the piano that I have today, A Yamaha P71</p>
            <p>I was never taught how to play the piano by teachers or parents. My father, in order to put me to sleep as a child would play classical music on the radio next to my crib which he tells me, was the only thing that could put me to sleep. I believe that this habit would eventually flourish into me writing my own pieces on piano years later.</p>

From the tropics of Cambodia to the metropolitan streets of New York it seems like the notes that you play on the piano can garner a connection and unity seen only through music.</p>

           <p>Piano playing can help people in a variety of ways. One of the ways that it personally helps me is that it gives me a platform of endless possibilities that allows me to express myself in whatever way I feel at the time.</p>

           <p>According to Steinway and Sons, piano playing has shown to decrease the effect of aging in older people and, on average, leads to an increase in children's cognitive ability and spatial processing prowess</p>

            <p>The reason that piano matters and, by extension, art. Is for a very simple reason. The day that we abandon the things that bring color into the world, we, like the man in the image will forget who we are. The caption for the image is a lie. My original AI prompt was,</p>
            <p>"Community of many piano players"</p>
            <p>But I believe that the image that it generated is much more telling of the state of the world and the things that we need to do in order to bring the beauty back. Sometimes all someone needs is a person to share a song with.</p>
